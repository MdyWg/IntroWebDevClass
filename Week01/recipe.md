- 8 ounce container room temperature mascarpone cheese (225 g)
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar (67 g)

## Steps
1. Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.
2. Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them–just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8×8'' or similar size pan. 
3. Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.
4. Dust cocoa powder generously over the top. Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.
